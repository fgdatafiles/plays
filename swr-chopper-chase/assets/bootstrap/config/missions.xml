<!-- 
	Mission data structure:
	id: String. This is the reference label for the mission used in the code.
	title: String. The name of the mission seen by players. [TODO] better formatting than adding in actual line breaks
	description: String. Text that comes up in the mission briefing.
	difficulty: Int. Rating from 1-5 that states how hard the mission is.
	levels: Array of asdkfghose: Set of level IDs that will determine what Levels to use for this mission.
	mainCharacter: Determines focus character that should say an intro line upon choosing the mission.
	mainLoc: Determines which intro line the character will say (imperial or ghost)
	showStatus: Determines how the mission appears (or doesn't appear) on the episode select screen:
		0 = Hidden. Mission is based on a TV episode that hasn't been released yet.
		1 = Highlighted. Mission's based on a recent TV episode, and should have the word NEW printed on it.
		2 = Normal. Mission appears normally in the list with no bells or whistles.
	video: String. This is played upon completing the mission.
	
	Level data structure:
	id: Int. Value that ConstantsApp.INT_LEVEL should be set to to get this leveldata... Or something.
	title: String. Displays name of this level on the briefing screen.
	description: String. Description of level shown when loading.
	location: String. Read in to determine which set of maps/starting location that we should assume for CHOPPER.
	win: String. What string to print when the level's steps are done.
	endingSting: String. The piece of music that should play upon reaing the win dialogue.
	steps: Array of the things below: Set of step datas used to construct different scenarios in the level.
	specialBG: A step switch that's used to insert special background conditions into each level.
		-If left blank, this defaults to... Well, default.
		-"SPACE" - Used for imperial bases, space puts view of beautiful space in the windows and computer screens.
		-"ASTEROID" - outside the window/screens, the base is on a space rock.
	
	Step data structure:
	Intro: String. Dialog featured at the start of this stage. Parts that look like /THIS/ are character names, used to deduce portraits. They also separate messages.
	Type: Int. Determines how the step goes:
		1 = Random. Alerts appear at random.
		2 = Targeted. The minigame defined below is spawned. It must be completed to move on. While failing can generate other alerts, they are unrelated and do not permit further progress.
		3 = Event. The minigame will use a special string to activate a custom script upon complete. Same as 2. See below.
	Minigames: String. A string of letters (ABDEF) that determines which minigame types to spawn. Can also put in a number (13) to define a specific alert index to use.
	Sidequests: String. Same format as Minigames. Used in type 2/3 games as side problems that need to be done, but do not progress the game.
	Winsneed: Int. Determines how many minigames you need to win to move on.
	Lose: String. This is said when the mission is failed.
	Event: String. When type is 3, this string will be read in by World on minigame completion, and perform its action.
	effect: Determines combination of visual effects and sound effects to play while in this stage:
		-"none" - No sound or anything.
		-"attacked" - Sounds of lasers hitting the ship, coinciding with screen shakes.
		-"turbulence" - infrequent screen shakes. Either no sounds, or minor rumbles.
		-"selfdestruct" = constant shaking, and the sound of klaxon.
		-"poweroutage" - darkness overlay on whole screen. Used for abandoned stuff or when Ghost gets a burned out lightbulb.
		-"URGENT" - special effect, used on empire bases. No screen effects, but this will play intense music. It also speeds up alert timers (there should be very few active alerts), but this functionality might be offline.
	npcEzra: string & 2 integers separated by comma (Cargo, 11,9 for example) determining where Ezra should show up. Refer to constantsapp for info on what room names to use. 4th is a custom animation, and 5th is intonation of the line.
	npcHera
	npcSabine
	npcKanan
	npcZeb
	NOTE: The characters that have unique 'help' lines are Ezra and Sabine.
	If you need a mood, but don't need a pose, just leave the 4th string blank, and it'll default to standing.
	sting: if set, this will play a small musical sting when this step begins. Refer to the assets folder for different names.
	music: if set, this step will have its own music play, overriding whatever's set in effect.
	
	ezraDialog et.al: string. This is what an NPC should say when interacted with at the given moment.
