TERMS OF USE

(See Summary of Most Significant Changes to learn more.)

This is the legal part of the show. It's just so everybody knows the rules for Nickelodeon on the Web. Be sure to get your parents to review and discuss these rules with you:

    All the toys, videos and games here are just for you to play with. You can't sell them, give them to anyone, or pretend you made them. You can't do anything EXCEPT play with them, unless you ask us first and we say it's OK. Kind of like playing with your big sister's toys, right?
    If you see something you don't like, remember that all the stuff in the comments come straight from other kids, not from someone at Nick.com. Nick.com wouldn't tell kids what to say, because kids have minds of their own! But if someone posts ugly comments, we'll do our best to take care of it. We all want nick.com to be a good, clean place to hang out.
    If you write something in a comment that catches our eye, we might want to use it on the site. By posting your thoughts and getting your parent's permission to do so, you and your parents are telling us it's ok to repeat what you say. It's even ok to put it in an advertisement. It means we can use it in any way we want, anywhere, until the end of time. And wouldn't it be cool if we used something YOU said until the end of time?

Remember to ALWAYS check with your parents before you send anything to us. After all, they might want it to put on the fridge!

Of course, the folks in the legal office upstairs have their own special way of saying all that. Here's their version (also known as The Small Print):

This is the official Terms of Use Agreement ("Agreement") for the website, application or other interactive service that includes an authorized link to this Agreement and all other websites, applications and other interactive services you also use that are offered by the Nickelodeon Group brand that is providing this website, application or other interactive service (collectively, all such websites, applications and other interactive services, "Site," "we," "us" or "our"). This Site is fully controlled and operated by Nickelodeon, a business unit of Viacom Media Networks, a division of Viacom International, Inc. ("VMN") (Viacom International Inc., along with its parent company Viacom Inc. and all affiliates that Viacom Inc. directly or indirectly owns or controls (such as Paramount Pictures Corporation and the other affiliates of Viacom Media Networks as described in the link here, shall be referred to collectively as "VII"). By accessing and using this Site, you are hereby agreeing to be legally bound by the Terms of Use of VMN. We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to change, modify or otherwise alter these Terms of Use at any time. Such changes and/or modifications shall become effective immediately upon the posting thereof. Please review the Terms of Use periodically. Your continued use of the Site following the posting of changes and/or modifications will constitute your acceptance of the revised Terms of Use.

TEXT MESSAGING MARKETING AND PROMOTIONS

Consistent with local law, appropriately aged visitors may have the opportunity to register for special promotions, services, news, programming and information delivered via text messaging (collectively, "Text Service(s)") on wireless devices such as mobile phones and, if we do so, we will require your prior express consent for any Text Services in accordance with the nature of the Text Service and applicable laws, rules and regulations. The information requested or transmitted as part of the registration process includes your wireless telephone number and may include other information, such as your preferences regarding goods or services, choices of music or artists, or other similar survey information and/or an email address. Depending on the Text Service and the information collected, you may also be required to confirm your agreement to this Agreement (including, but not limited to, the Privacy Policy and Rules).

If you register for the Text Services, you acknowledge, understand and agree that you may be charged by your wireless carrier for the ability to send or receive all such messages. The standard messaging rates of your wireless carrier shall apply to all Text Services, unless noted otherwise. Under no circumstances shall the Nickelodeon Group or VII be responsible for any wireless service charges incurred by you or by a person that has access to your wireless device, telephone number, or email address. If you change or deactivate your wireless telephone number, you agree to notify us when your wireless telephone number is no longer associated with you and identify such wireless phone number to ensure that future messages directed to you are not sent to the person to whom your old number has been or will be assigned.

You understand, acknowledge and agree that we may, at our sole discretion and without liability to you or any user, terminate our offer of any specific Text Service or all Text Services at any time without advance notice. VMN may provide notice of terminations or changes in services on this Site.

You hereby represent and warrant that you have all necessary rights in and to all Postings you provide and all information they contain and that such Postings shall not infringe any proprietary or other rights of third parties or contain any libelous, tortious, or otherwise unlawful information. You hereby authorize VMN to use, and authorize others to use, your Postings in whole or in part, on a royalty-free basis, throughout the universe in perpetuity in any and all media, now known or hereafter devised, alone, or together or as part of other material of any kind or nature. Without limiting the foregoing, VMN will have the right to use and change the Postings in any manner that VMN may determine.

RESOLUTION OF DISPUTES: BINDING ARBITRATION; NO CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTIONS OR ARBITRATIONS

See our FAQs for more information.

    Binding Arbitration and Exclusions from Arbitration. EXCEPT AS PROVIDED BELOW OR UNLESS YOU SUBMIT A VALID ARBITRATION/CLASS ACTION WAIVER OPT-OUT NOTICE (AS DESCRIBED IN SUB-SECTION 5 BELOW), ANY AND ALL CLAIMS BETWEEN YOU AND VII WILL BE RESOLVED IN BINDING ARBITRATION RATHER THAN IN COURT. You and VII agree to submit to individual arbitration the resolution of any and all Claims by or between you and/or VII, except that you and VII agree that the following will not be subject to the mandatory arbitration provisions in this Sub-section 1: (A) any Claim filed by you or VII with respect to any violation, enforcement or validity of patent, trademark, trade dress, service mark, copyright and/or trade secret rights of you, VII, or any third party, including, but not limited to, Claims related to content that you upload to or share on the Site and/or (B) you or VII may seek a preliminary injunction, restraining order or other provisional equitable relief in any court as provided in "GOVERNING LAW, ARBITRATION LOCATION, JURISDICTION, VENUE, JURISDICTION AND JURY TRIAL WAIVER" below in connection with any Claim whereby you or VII, as applicable, may suffer immediate and irreparable harm for which money damages may be inadequate and impossible to calculate (including, but not limited to, a Claim under Sub-section 1(A)), where such Claim under this Sub-section 1(B) will not be subject to the informal dispute resolution procedures described in Sub-section 2 below; provided, however, that, subsequent to obtaining such preliminary injunction, restraining order or other provisional equitable relief, the Claim will then be submitted to arbitration in accordance with this Section of the Agreement. You and VII agree that this Agreement affects interstate commerce, and that the enforceability of this Section of the Agreement will be governed by, construed, and enforced, both procedurally and substantively, by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. sections 1-9 ("FAA"). Arbitration is the referral of a dispute to one or more impartial persons for a final and binding determination. There is no judge or jury in arbitration, discovery is more limited than in court, there are no class or representative proceedings, and court review of an arbitration decision is limited. An arbitrator must follow this Agreement and can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including, but not limited to, injunctive and declaratory relief, statutory damages, and attorneys' fees). "Claim(s)" means any dispute, claim or controversy by or between you and/or VII relating to the Site and/or this Agreement (including, but not limited to, this Site's Privacy Policy and any additional terms that govern certain products and/or services which are presented in conjunction with those products and/or services, Rules, regulations, procedures and policies which we refer to in this Agreement), as may be modified from time-to-time, and the subject matter hereof, including, but not limited to, any contract, tort, statutory, or equity claims
    Informal Dispute Resolution. Except with respect to Claims described in Sub-section 1(B) above, before either you or VII pursue or participate in any Claim against the other party in arbitration or court proceedings, you or VII must notify the other party of the Claim in writing at least 60 days in advance of initiating the arbitration or court proceeding in order to provide a reasonable opportunity to resolve the Claim. You may send a written notice of your Claim to VII at 1515 Broadway, New York, New York 10036, Attention: Viacom Inc. General Counsel. VII may send written or electronic notice of its Claim to your email address, VII account or any physical or other address VII has for you. The notice must describe the Claim in reasonable detail and set forth the relief requested so that the other party has an opportunity to adequately address the Claim. Except with respect to Claims described in Sub-section 1(B) above, you and VII agree to negotiate in good faith with each other to try to informally resolve the Claim and, if you and VII do not reach an informal resolution of the Claim within 60 days, then the Claim may be submitted to binding arbitration as set forth in this Section of the Agreement or court as permitted by Sub-section 1 above.
    Arbitration Proceedings and Costs. Any arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") pursuant to its Consumer Arbitration Rules (the "AAA Rules"), as modified by this Agreement. The AAA Rules, and other information about the AAA, are available at the AAA's website at www.adr.org. A form for initiating arbitration proceedings is available on the AAA's website (see Demand for Arbitration at https://www.adr.org/aaa/ShowPDF?doc=ADRSTG_015820 and, for arbitrations in California, https://www.adr.org/aaa/ShowPDF?doc=ADRSTG_015822, but contact the AAA if you have issues accessing these links) and arbitration proceedings shall be initiated in the location described in "GOVERNING LAW, ARBITRATION LOCATION, JURISDICTION, VENUE, JURISDICTION AND JURY TRIAL WAIVER" below. As required by the AAA Rules, if you initiate the arbitration proceedings, you must send the original copy of the completed form to VII, which should be sent to VII at the following address: 1515 Broadway, New York, New York 10036, Attention: Viacom Inc. General Counsel. If your Claim is for $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely based on documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing under the AAA Rules. In all cases, you and VII shall exchange documents and other information that you or VII intend to use in the arbitration.

    Upon filing of an arbitration demand for Claims up to $75,000, VII will reimburse you for all necessary filing, administration and arbitrator fees paid by you to the AAA or, if you wish VII to pay such fees directly to the AAA, you must request payment of such fees by VII by mail to the AAA along with your form initiating arbitration and VII will make arrangements to pay such fees directly to the AAA. In the event the arbitrator determines that the Claim(s) you assert in the arbitration are frivolous or vexatious, you agree to reimburse VII for all fees associated with the arbitration paid by VII on your behalf. You agree that VII shall have no obligation to pay any other fees except as determined by the arbitrator.

    For Claims that total more than $75,000, the AAA Rules will govern payment of filing, administration and arbitrator fees to the maximum extent permitted by law. The decision of the arbitrator will be binding and conclusive on all parties, and judgment to enforce the decision may be entered by any court of competent jurisdiction.
    Class Action Waiver. UNLESS YOU SUBMIT A VALID ARBITRATION/CLASS ACTION WAIVER OPT-OUT NOTICE (AS DESCRIBED IN SUB-SECTION 5), YOU AND VII AGREE THAT ANY DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEEDINGS WHETHER IN ARBITRATION OR IN COURT WILL BE CONDUCTED ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT IN A CLASS, CONSOLIDATED OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION. You and VII expressly agree that any Claim is personal to you and VII, shall only be resolved by an individual arbitration (or individual court proceedings with respect to Claims excluded from mandatory arbitration as described in Sub-section 1 of this Agreement), and shall in no event be brought as a class arbitration, a class action, or any other representative proceeding. The arbitrator (or court if the Claim is excluded from mandatory arbitration as described in Sub-section 1 of this Agreement) may only conduct an individual arbitration (or court action if the Claim is excluded from mandatory arbitration as described in Sub-section 1 of this Agreement), and may not consolidate more than one person's claims and may not preside over any form of representative or class proceeding. If a court or arbitrator determines that this class action waiver is unenforceable in an action between you and VII, then this Agreement to arbitrate will be unenforceable. Neither you nor VII consent to class arbitration.
    Right to Opt Out of Mandatory Arbitration and Class Action Waiver. IF YOU DO NOT WISH TO BE BOUND BY THE MANDATORY ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER PROVISIONS IN SUB-SECTIONS 1, 3 AND 4, YOU MUST NOTIFY VII IN WRITING (THE "Arbitration/Class Action Waiver Opt-Out Notice"), WHERE THE ARBITRATION/CLASS ACTION WAIVER OPT-OUT NOTICE MEETS ALL OF THE FOLLOWING REQUIREMENTS:

    (a) Sent by first class mail, postage prepaid, certified and return receipt requested or sent by overnight courier service (such as Federal Express) to Viacom Inc., Attention: Viacom Legal Department, Records Management, 1515 Broadway, 51st Floor, New York, NY 10036.

    (b) Postmarked (if sent by first class mail) or deposited with the overnight courier service no later than (A), if you register as a new registered user of the Site on or after 2/9/2016 ("Agreement to Arbitrate Date"), 45 days after the date you accept this Agreement for the first time, unless an earlier deadline in Sub-section 5.2(C) applies, (B), if you are already a registered user of the Site before the Agreement to Arbitrate Date, 45 days after the earlier of either (I) your first log in to the Site on or after the Agreement to Arbitrate Date or (II) the date which email notice of the Agreement containing this Section of the Agreement, if any, was sent to the email address associated with your user registration, unless an earlier deadline in Sub-section 5.2(C) applies or (C) for all other users of the Site, 45 days after you accept this Agreement for the first time on or after the Agreement to Arbitrate Date, unless a longer period is required by applicable law.

    Time Periods Applicable to Users of Multiple VII Websites, Applications or Other Interactive Services. If you are or become a user of more than one VII website, application or other interactive service, you must provide the Arbitration/Class Action Waiver Opt-Out Notice within the earliest deadline applicable for any VII website, application or other interactive service for which you are or become a user (for example, if the Agreement to Arbitrate Date is August 1 and if you are a pre-existing registered user of a VII website prior to August 1 who logins on August 1 and registers as a new registered user of another VII website on August 15, you must provide the Arbitration/Class Action Waiver Opt-Out Notice by September 15 (45 days after August 1 and not 45 days after August 15)).

    (c) Includes your first and last name, address, phone number, email address and, if applicable, your username if you are a registered user of the VII website(s), application(s) or other interactive services(s) along with an identification of the VII website(s), application(s) or other interactive services(s) for each such username. We shall use the foregoing information included in the Arbitration/Class Action Waiver Opt-Out Notice to record, process, maintain and administer your opt-out of the mandatory arbitration and class action waiver provisions and not for marketing purposes.

    (d) Includes a statement that you do not agree to the mandatory arbitration and class action waiver.

    If the Arbitration/Class Action Waiver Opt-Out Notice meets all of the above requirements, you will be deemed to have opted out of the mandatory arbitration and class action waiver provisions in Sub-section 1, Sub-section 3 and Sub-section 4 with respect to all VII websites, applications or other interactive services (including, but not limited to, those owned, operated and/or provided by Viacom Inc. and the corporate affiliates that Viacom Inc. directly or indirectly owns or controls such as those described in the link here). Note that a valid Arbitration/Class Action Waiver Opt-Out Notice applies only to the individual identified in such notice as opting out.

    If the Arbitration/Class Action Waiver Opt-Out Notice does not meet all of the above requirements, you will not be deemed to have opted out of the mandatory arbitration and class action waiver provisions in Sub-section 1, Sub-section 3 and Sub-section 4.

GOVERNING LAW, ARBITRATION LOCATION, JURISDICTION, VENUE, AND JURY TRIAL WAIVER

With the exception of the provision above that the enforceability of "RESOLUTION OF DISPUTES: BINDING ARBITRATION; NO CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTIONS OR ARBITRATIONS" above is governed both procedurally and substantively by the FAA, this Agreement and your use of the Site is otherwise governed by, construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of New York (without regard to that state's conflict of laws rules).

You or VII shall initiate arbitration in the United States county or territory in which you reside or, if you do not reside in the United States or one of its territories, in the non-United States country in which you reside; provided, however, that (a) VII may request to transfer the arbitration to New York County, New York if it agrees to pay any additional fees or costs you incur as a result of the change in location as such additional fees or costs are determined by the arbitrator and to the maximum extent permitted by law and, upon such request, (b)(i) if you agree to such request, the arbitration shall be transferred to New York County, New York or (ii) if you do not agree to such request, VII shall have right to request that the arbitrator determine the location in which the arbitration shall be held. You and VII agree that any Claim that is allowed to proceed in court as set forth in Sub-section 1 of "RESOLUTION OF DISPUTES: BINDING ARBITRATION; NO CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTIONS OR ARBITRATIONS" above (including, but not limited to, as a result of your submission of a valid Arbitration/Class Action Waiver Opt-Out Notice), or otherwise proceeds in court in the event the agreement to arbitrate above is found not to apply to you or a particular Claim as a result of a decision by the arbitrator or a court order, is subject to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the State or Federal Courts situated in the Borough of Manhattan, New York City, State of New York.

To the extent it may be applicable, you and VII agree to opt out from and expressly exclude any applicability of the Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act. If any Claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, YOU AND VII WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL.
